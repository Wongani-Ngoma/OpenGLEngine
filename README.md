# OpenGL Engine
Renderer with some features like physics, gameplay elements etc

## Added stuff from previous renderer:
Migration from Bullet3 to Physx

Post processing effects

Scene saving and loading (via JSON files)

Better debug mode:
  Now uses a raycast to select an object pointed to by the cursor(incomplete and broken), once selected, the object and be moved.

Some gameplay elements (1st and 3rd person camera modes)

Shadow mapping ? (broken)
